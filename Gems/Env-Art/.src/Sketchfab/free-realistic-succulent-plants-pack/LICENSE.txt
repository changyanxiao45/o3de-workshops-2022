Details:
The original downloaded source was unzipped here (.zip delted to save space)
The texture moved from .src to assets: Env-Art\Assets\Objects\Succulent-Plants\textures (one copy, also to save space)
The FBX was imported into Maya (scene units meters, Z-up)r
The hierarchy was rearranged, to prep for LOD hierarchy (spines are heavy)
The scene was resized (scaled to meter cube as ref)
The root nodes were renamed (to clean up)
Each object was duplicated (Shift + D) to make a copy and remove instancing (so transforms could be frozen)
^ hmm, that didn't work
spines were instances below the body shape,
so collapsed (combined) the spines (which moves the combines as a shape to a new node)
then delete history all (gets rid of all the old instance transforms)
then reparent hierachy
then for each object, I created _LOD0 grp, duplicated to _LOD1 and removed the spines from the _LOD1
then used 'LOD group' to put _LOD0 and _LOD1 into a Maya LOD group
maya renames LOD_0 and LOD_1, those o3de won't see, so manually renamed back to _LOD0 and _LOD1
I had moved the textures from the .src, down into assets folder (so only one copy)
So I used the 'File Path Editor' to repath them to the new location
In o3de, the material node name becomes the name of the material assignment slot in the 'material component' so I cleaned up the material node names
From there it was just several rounds of itertive clean up, LODs and export (used the game exporter)
